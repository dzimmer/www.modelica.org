| [![ModelicaByExample.png](/images/books/Tiller2014.png)](https://mbe.modelica.university/) | **Michael Tiller** \- ["Modelica by Example"](https://mbe.modelica.university/) (2014). Michael Tiller's latest online book on Modelica is the result of a Kickstarter project whose goal was to produce a freely accessible book on Modelica. The book starts off with a discussions on modeling various types of behavior in Modelica (equations, discrete events, differential equations). This is followed by a step-by-step explanation of how to create reusable component models, subsystems and architectures that encapsulated the mathematical behavior. Along the way, various Modelica features like arrays and functions are also introduced. |

The second edition features improvements and updates of the Modelica language including synchronous clocked constructs, examines basic concepts of cyber-physical, equation-based, object-oriented system modeling and simulation. This text is aimed at System Modeling and Simulation engineers, control engineers, mechanical engineers, those working with CAD (Computer Aided Design), virtual reality, biochemistry, embedded systems, and data communication. The book can be ordered from both [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Object-Oriented-Modeling-Simulation-Modelica/dp/111885912X) and from [Wiley](https://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111885912X.html) with the discount code VBG91. |

This book offers an introduction to the development and simulation of Modelica models for engineering applications. The target audience are bachelor's or master's level students, interested in modeling and simulation, and with a background in both physics and numerical methods. The book is structured into three parts. The modeling methodology and the Modelica features for continuous-time modeling are discussed in the first part of the book. The simulation of continuous-time Modelica models is addressed in the second part of the book. The third part of the book is devoted to discuss hybrid modeling and simulation in Modelica. The modeling methodology, the Modelica language features, and the use of modeling environments are explained by means of examples.  |

This exercise book provides an introduction to the simulation practice in Engineering using Modelica. To this end, it contains a series of thirteen independent hands-on assignments of increasing complexity. Each assignment contains the description of a system and a mathematical model of the system's behavior. The proposed task often consists in describing this mathematical model in the Modelica language and simulate it. In some assignments, the system's behavior is described as an atomic model, without internal structure. Some other assignments ask to design and implement a model library, and to compose the system model by instantiating and connecting components from this model library. |

The book is 232 pages, uses downloadable exercises and solution, and uses the Modelica language standard version 3.1. |

This book (written in German) gives an introduction to two aspects of the design of technical systems: Analytical analysis and control of their stability and non-linear simulation of their behavior in the time domain. The first part of the book covers the standard methods of classical control and thus gives a foundation to understand modern simulation tools. In the second part several technical examples are used to explain modelling and simulation approaches. They start with a simple linear electrical oscillator, followed by a non-linear pendulum, a bouncing ball, heat conduction in a long rod and a pneumatic bellows. These examples are first used to introduce simple numerical integration algorithms and their pitfalls and later to explain basic concepts and operators in Modelica. The most important Modelica keywords and operators are listed and explained in a separate chapter. The book is intended for students and engineers of mechanical engineering. |

| [![Modelica by Application Power Systems V1.1](/images/books/Elsheikh2021.png)](https://github.com/Mathemodica/ModelicaPowerSystemBook) | **Atiyah Elsheikh and Peter Palensky** \- ["Modelica by Application Power Systems V1.1"](https://github.com/Mathemodica/ModelicaPowerSystemBook) (2021). An E-book illustrating the Modelica language from Power Systems perspective. However, since the e-book is following a fundamental approach, some chapters are domain independent and are also useful for readers not necessarily interested in power system modeling applications, e.g. Historical evolution of domain-independent system modeling principles. The e-book can be also an ideal guide for Modelica modelers seeking a better understanding of power system modeling applications. Individual chapters are accessible online. Optionally, the whole e-book can be purchased for as-much-as-you-think-the-ebook-deserves. |

The book (written in German) gives an introduction to Modelica in the field of electrical engineering with a particular focus on polyphase electric machines. Simulation examples of the open source library [HanserModelica](https://www.hanser-fachbuch.de/fachbuch/artikel/9783446455511) include transient and quasi stationary electric circuits including electrical systems coupled to the magnetic, thermal and mechanical domain. The theory and the implementation of the polyphase electrical machines enclosed in the Modelica Standard Library are explained in detail. Each application examples of the HanserModelica library can be simulated in OpenModelica (HanserModelica is included in [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org/) 1.13.0 as system library). The book also includes a brief tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/christiankral/HanserModelica) to explain how a Modelica project can be initiated, developed and maintained. |

This book teaches modeling and simulation and gives an introduction as well as a very comprenhensive overview of the Modelica language including many examples. Moreover, about one third of the book is devoted to application examples and related application background theory. Many of these examples are available in downloadable executable form from the OpenModelica.org web site. Part four of the book gives an overview of the most important symbolic and numeric methods used in typical Modelica tools. Appendices include parts of the Modelica standard library. The whole book is 940 pages long.  [Book excerpts.](http://www.ida.liu.se/labs/pelab/modelica/OpenModelica/Documents/ModelicaBookExcerpts.pdf) [More...](http://www.mathcore.com/drmodelica) |
