**Proceedings of the 16th International Modelica & FMI Conference Published -   
Special Highlight on Free Modelica Libraries**

The [Proceedings of the 16th International Modelica & FMI Conference](https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp218)  are now published via the electronic press of Link√∂ping Universitet.

With over 1000 pages, they give a detailed account on the technical progress that was discussed at our biennial conference. The feedback we have received directly after the conference was that this edition had a stronger focus on multi-domain tools, and general methodologies rather than just individual applications. Something that seemed to be very much welcomed by our audience, certainly fostered by the stronger inclusion of FMI and related standards and it also is reflected in the proceedings.

Many corresponding presentations can be also found on the [conference app](https://pretalx.com/16thmodelicafmiconference/schedule). In addition to the proceedings, this includes also the keynote presentations and presentations from the industrial users track.

In addition to papers and presentations, there is another important form to contribute to the common body of knowledge that I want to highlight now: these are the free open-source Modelica libraries.  This is the most direct way of transferring modeling know-how between persons and organizations. Either by applying the models directly in simulation or by studying the equations behind them.

1. [Pharmacolibrary](https://github.com/creative-connections/Pharmacolibrary): This library introduces Modelica to the field of Pharmacology and thereby enables the mechanistic modeling of drug behavior and response that is essential for rational drug development and personalized therapy.
2. [URDFModelica](https://github.com/DLR-RM/urdfmodelica ): The Unified Robot Description Format is commonly used within its community. This free software enables the automatic Modelica model generation from this format and thereby makes Modelica much better accessible and useful for the robotics community. 
3. [SMArtInt Library](https://github.com/xrg-simulation/SMArtInt): This library offers users a straightforward and efficient approach of integrating artificial intelligence via neural networks directly into Modelica models. 

Furthermore, five more libraries have been handed in for award. All quality contributions that are listed here in alphabetical order:

- [Absolut Modelica Library](https://github.com/carlesRT/Absolut): A library specialized on absorption heat exchangers.

- [Multi Energy Systems](https://github.com/RSE-TGM/multienergysystem): A library for the dynamic modeling and simulation of district heating and gas betworks.

- [ShipSim](https://github.com/BasilioPV/ShipSIM): a library for the assessment of ship maneuverability.  Components for the propulsion system as well as for hydrostatics and hydrodynamics make it especially useful for the conceptual design phase of ship building.

- [Toroid](https://github.com/HerbertSchmidt75/Toroid ): This library specializes on efficient models for (magnetic) toroid flux tubes verified against FEM analysis.

- [VDCWorkbench](https://github.com/DLR-VSDC/VDCWorkbench):  Modelica-based library that can be used as a workbench for the design, testing and validation of vehicle dynamics controllers and energy management algorithms of electric vehicles.

Last but not least, there were larger and smaller updates to already well-established open-source libraries
-	[Chemical 2.0](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Chemical): features an improved interface for substance properties and introduces  chemokinetics that helps to avoid difficult non-linear equation systems and increases robustness.

-	[Transient Library](https://github.com/TransiEnt-official/transient-lib): Designed for integrated energy systems. Many updates including improvements for large district heating networks.

-	[DLR ThermoFluidStream](https://github.com/DLR-SR/ThermofluidStream ): a significant update on the pump models that increases usability and accuracy.

The Modelica Association want to express its highest gratitude to all authors and developers for all these highly valuable contributions to our beloved field of mathematical modeling and simulation of dynamic systems.
